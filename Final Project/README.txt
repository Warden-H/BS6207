Note:
1.The output files includes test_prediction.txt & test_predction_no_softmax.txt.The difference between the 2 files is:
>>>test_prediction.txt is the result produced after the transformation of one softmax layer with the model output.Please mainly refer to this file!!!
>>>test_prediction_no_softmax.txt is the result produced directly by the model output. This file may be for comparison & reference purpose only. 

File Explanation:
Code:
(1) Model_Train.py:
>>> The file to build and train the model(including data preparation)
(2) Produce_Result.py:
>>> The file to produce the required result
Output Files:
(1) test_prediction.txt:
>>> The files of top 10 matching ligand list for all of the proteins generated by the Softmax transformed output from the model.
(2) test_prediction.txt:
>>> The files of top 10 matching ligand list for all of the proteins generated without the Softmax transformed output from the model.
